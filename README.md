# Client Management System

This is an app I built for my senior year of High School. 

This project was formerly called Tax Keeper as this app was built for my mother, a Notary, who needed a way to archive her clients' tax documents.

However, I renamed this project to Client Management system as I thought it was a more suitable name for the app that's functionality I have extended to be more versatile.

In this repo, you could view all my code, the table structure of my database, and my project documentation.
